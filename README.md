# app-reusable-components
Repo for storing reusable plug-and-play components.

**Repo Usage**
1. Base Boilerplates are not to be edited unless there is a consensus to update them or a bug fix. 
2. We will create project-specific usages of the boilerplate in a separate folder as and when applicable. This is to store the modified components in a similar place whilst keeping the base component clean.

**Handling PRs and Branches**
1. Once there is a consensus, anyone with access can raise and accept PR.
2. There is just ONE MASTER BRANCH. All others must be pruned after the PR is over.


**UI Defaults**
1. Components will be built by default in JavaScript and not in typescript.
2. Web-based components are in ReactJS.
3. Native Apps, if are built with React-Native are stored as such. If done with CLIs, will be stored under their platform folders (iOS or Android)
4. Helper Functions (js) and Functional Components(jsx) are to be stored separately.
